# table1 1.5

* Improvements to `kableExtra` output generated by `t1kable()`.

* Improved `render.strat` and `render.varlabel` to make them more flexible. The
  function `render.strat.default()` has been removed, and the arguments to
  `render.strat` are different now, so this could be a breaking change for some
  users.

* Add weighted statistics.

* Fix extra columns with column groups (#106).

* Fix bug in `t1flex()` (#103).

* Handle `NA` in `parse.abbrev.render.code()`.

# table1 1.4.3

* Change space in `as.data.frame.table1()` (#60).

* Add `NMISS` to output of `stats.default()` for categorical variables.

* Handle `NMISS` properly in `stats.apply.rounding()` (no decimals).

* Fix handling of abbreviated code with `render.missing`.

* Correct default rounding of `PCTnoNA` (ie, using `digits.pct`).

* Fix issue with `t1kable` (#82).

* Fix a problem with `t1kable` when the row with the label contains data.

* Choose between `qflextable`, `flextable` and `regulartable` in `t1flex`.

* Add extra columns to groupspan headers in t1flex and t1kable (#93).

* Option to place overall on the left (#88).

* Missing values in stratification variable(s) raises and error (#80).

# table1 1.4.2

* Add option `rounding.fn` to `stats.apply.rounding()` to allow changing the
  rounding behaviour (thanks to Niels Hagenbuch for the suggestion)

* Add geometric standard deviation (GSD) to the output of `stats.default()`.

* Fixed error when passing `digits` (thanks to Niels Hagenbuch for reporting this).

* Fixed integer formatting (issue #55).

* Fixed issue #53.

# table1 1.4.1

* Fix a warning in one of the examples.

# table1 1.4

* Headline feature: ability to convert `table1` output to a `data.frame`,
  `flextable` or `kableExtra` object (though with some limitations). As a
  direct consequence, `table1` can now be used within LaTeX documents, and
  there is a new vignette to document this feature. Output to .docx is also
  possible with this feature (through pandoc or `flextable`).

* Fomulas containing dot ('.') are now handled correctly (the '.' means "all
  variables other than those that appear elsewhere in the formula").

* Arguments to formatC (e.g. big.mark) will apply to all numbers by default
  (previously, only continuous variables had this).

* New `setLabel()` function provides an alternative syntax for setting labels
  (useful for setting a label inside a formula).

# table1 1.3

* The headline feature is the `extra.col` option, which gives a flexible way to
  add extra columns (e.g. P-values, SMD, ...) to the table (thanks to Matt
  Leipzig for helping out with suggestions and testing on this).

* Footnotes now appear in a <tfoot> tag for better placement.

* General improvements to the documentation.

# table1 1.2.1

* Fixed issue that was causing vignette build to fail (due to changes made to
  the MatchIt package's lalonde data set).

* Allow multiple footnotes.

# table1 1.2

* Added `caption` argument to generate a caption for the table.

* Set `render.missing=NULL` to ignore missing values.

* Added `SUM` to `stats.default` for continuous variables.

* Added `PCTnoNA` to `stats.default` and `na.is.category` option to
  `render.categorical.default`.

* Changed (n=XX) to (N=XX) in default table header.

* Improved error handling in function `eqcut`.

* Function `signif_pad` can now use different decimal marks to support
  different locales.

* Added function `round_pad` (similar to `signif_pad` but for fixed rounding).

* Added function `t1read`.

# table1 1.1

* Added `quantile.type` argument to `stats.default` to allow selecting which
  quantile type is computed.

* Special handling for "0%" and "100%" in `stats.apply.rounding` so that no
  decimals are shown.

* `droplevels` now works properly with nested grouping.

* `table1` now returns a character string (containing HTML). A print method
  handles the printing. There is no longer a need to use `capture.output` to
  embed `table1` in a shiny app.

* Removed `standalone` option as it is no longer needed.

* Use `htmltools` functionality to print.

* Preview in RStudio notebook now works ([issue #7](https://github.com/benjaminrich/table1/issues/7)).

* Added `knit_print` method. No need to specify `results="asis"` chunk option
  anymore when knitting.

* Default CSS is included automatically. It can still be overridden by
  specifying a custom stylesheet in R Markdown.

* Changed notation from upper case "Q" to small case "q" for percentiles in
  `stats.default`.

* `Q1` and `Q3` are now aliases for `q25` and `q75` respectively in
  `stats.default`.

* Tertiles added to `stats.default`.

* New function `eqcut` for creating equal-sized categories from continuous
  variables.

* New `footnote` argument for adding a footnote to the table.

* The vignette has been expanded with new examples and the documentation
  improved.

# table1 1.0

* This is the initial release of table1 on CRAN.
